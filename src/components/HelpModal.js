            DCS Fiddle is a DCS Lua playground, it has an IDE and a console pane
            allowing you execute commands inside DCS over HTTP.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            It works by installing a script into DCS that starts a minimal HTTPD
            using pure LUA.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            The LUA commands inside the IDE are translated and run inside DCS
            and the response is returned.
